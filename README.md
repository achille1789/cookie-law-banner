# cookie-law-banner

Extremely simple and highly customisable JavaScript script to create a banner that
warns the users that the website uses cookies.

When the user accepts a specific cookie is set on the browser.

The script can be used on any website, just add this code to the bottom of the body:

    <script src="cookie-js.js"></script>

At the top of the script it is possible to change:
* Banner text
* Buttons text
* URL of the webpage with the cookies description
* Position of the banner (top/bottom)
* Possibility to accept clicking via a link or scrolling the page

__The script must run on a server otherwise the cookie is not set up__
